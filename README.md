## Technologies Used
Wemeetup is developed with a Ruby on Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database and is hosted on Heroku. The backend provides RESTful API's and responds with JSON data. The front end is modeled with React and Redux and implements styling from CSS.

In addition, this website employed Jbuilder, NodeJs, JQuery to make AJAX requests, Node Package Manager (npm), webpack, React DOM, React Router, React History for browser history manipulation, and AWS for cloud hosting.

## Features
Users can create an account and log in securely (with bcrypt) with custom error handling. Once logged in, the user has access to a generalized index of created groups and can create a custom group for other users to view.
